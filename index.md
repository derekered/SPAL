# Our Origin Story
Our story begins deep in a pandemic in a Seattle home. Derek Cutting, like so many other Seattleites, felt alone and starved of connection to Seattle's rich cultural world. Rather than languish with these feelings, he decided to craft the community for which he yearned. A little push from his therapist also helped! 

In January 2022, the Seattle Performing Arts Lovers blossomed into existence with a small group of friends. Our shared longing for connection, community, and the magic of live performances drew us together.

# Who We Are

We're more than just a group; we're friends with a shared love for the arts. Our acroym says it all. **We are SPALs**. 

Amid the bustling streets and iconic venues of Seattle, we've created a haven for those who share our passion. 

# How it Works
Our approach is simple. We keep each other informed of interesting performances through our Google Groups email list serv, then we attend them together. From symphonies to rock concerts, ballets to forest dances, our tastes are as diverse as the city itself.

Beyond the performances, SPAL is a gateway to friendship and shared experiences. Whether we're indulging in pre-show dinners, dissecting the nuances of a performance over drinks, or catching up at a purely social gatherings, our connections deepen with every interaction. Many among us aren't just admirers, but active performers as well.
