### What kind of performances do SPALs go to? 
Any kind of live performance you can think of! We go to the symphony, indie rock concerts, ballet, contemporary dance, opera, and many more. Our goal is to support live performances in all their diverse ways of expressing themselves. 

Check out the [SPAL Music of 2022](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0tilDCwFB1aI1Y1hDGGfCd?si=0a1ee727e9804c8b){:target="_blank"} Spotify playlist of the music we heard at performances in 2022. 

### What is the social component?
For each event, we like to include a way to get to know each other better. That might include grabbing a drink before a show, having dinner afterward to discuss what we though, or a simple walk. Throughout the year we also have purely social events as well. 

### Should I reply all or privately?
I know at work reply all is taboo, but not here! Email is our primary mode of communication and we encourage reply all. The two instances most important to reply all are:
1. To let folks know you're coming to an event. Reply all to the invite. It helps build the excitement. 
2. To welcome new members. When a new member joins we'll send an intro email. Reply all to give them a warm welcome. 

### How do I host an outing to a performance? 
There are two ways to invite folks to a performance:
1. Fill out the [invite form](https://airtable.com/appC8JnbpRFWTOMs0/shrys9o6TSJqBaR7F){:target="_blank"}. It'll automatically send a message to the group to invite them to the event. 
2. Email the SPALs distro list directly. All members have permission to send to the group. Include details of the event, how you'll coordinate tickets (everyone on their own or a group order), and the social component. 

### Does it cost any money to join? 
There is no cost to be a member of SPALs. 

### What happens if I move away from Seattle?
You are welcome to stay on the distribution list. We hope you can join us for an event the next time you're in Seattle. Just give Derek a heads up that you're moving and he'll move you to alumni status.
