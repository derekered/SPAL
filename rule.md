Becoming a part of SPAL is as uncomplicated as it is enriching. To fully embrace the SPAL spirit, we ask just one thing: **organize at least one outing each year**. This entails sending an email to our [distribution list](mailto:seattle-performing-arts-lovers@googlegroups.com), extending an invitation to fellow SPALs for a performance you're eager to witness. We encourage you to infuse a social facet into these gatherings â€“ be it a delightful dinner or post-performance drinks. As guardians of both the live performance realm and the community we're fostering, your participation is an essential thread in the vibrant tapestry of SPAL.
