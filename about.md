Our story begins in a home at heart of Seattle. It was the beginning of 2022, deep into the pandemic. Derek Cutting, like so many other Seattleites, felt alone and starved of connection to Seattle's rich cultural world. Rather than languish with these feelings, he decided to craft the community for which he yearned. A little push from his therapist also helped! And so in January 2022, the Seattle Performing Arts Lovers blossomed into existence. Our shared longing for connection, community, and the magic of live performances drew us together.


We're more than just a group; we're a collective of kindred spirits bound by our love for the arts. Our acroym says it all; we are SPALs. Amid the bustling streets and iconic venues of Seattle, we've created a haven for those who share our passion. Our approach is simple, a low-pressure space where we gather to experience the artistry that moves us. From symphonies to rock concerts, ballet to forest dances, our tastes are as diverse as the city itself.


Beyond the performances, SPAL is a gateway to friendship and shared experiences. Many among us aren't just admirers, but active performers as well. Supporting one another is embedded in our ethos, infusing every event with camaraderie and warmth. Whether we're indulging in pre-show dinners, dissecting the nuances of a performance over drinks, or catching up at a purely social gatherings, our connections deepen with every interaction. Our digital hearth, the Google Groups email list serv, fuels our conversations and fosters inclusivity. We embrace the dreaded Reply All. Through SPAL, bonds are formed, horizons are expanded, and the city's cultural treasures become even more breathtaking when shared.


Welcome to our story, where the stage lights illuminate not just the performances, but the friendships that flourish in their glow. adasdasd
